# Galactic Flush

## Overview
This game is a fun and collaborative project created by my nephew and me. We developed it as a
playful experiment and homage to the classic Asteroids game, using Godot 4. Remember, this project
is all in fun and not to be taken too seriously!

## Play the Game
You can try the game online at: [Galactic Flush](https://floftar.github.io/galactic-flush/)

**Note**: The web export feature in Godot 4 still has some compatibility issues, especially with
macOS. Therefore, the game might not work on every machine.

## Inspiration
The development of this game was inspired by and based on the "Godot 4 Asteroids" tutorial by
[Kaan Alpar](https://www.youtube.com/@KaanAlpar). We followed the tutorial to understand the basics
and added our personal touch.
